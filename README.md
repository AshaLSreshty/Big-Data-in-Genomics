# Big-Data-in-Genomics

Dockerizing/Containerizing a genomic application to identify the eccDNA from the decoy predictions obtained from Circle-Map tool

Machine learning approach is implemented to identify the eccDNA based on certain criteria specified by Circle-Map

Random Forest algorithm was applied

The model was then used in a web application developed in Flask
